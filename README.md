The project is about SEP4 where we create an app for lizards management.

## GIT rules 

Always use the name of the story (eg: "SFE-6/redesign-login-button").

## Development server

Run `nx serve LizardsIncFe` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
