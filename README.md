- Test coverage available on: https://apetrackunit.github.io/lizards-inc-fe/2

Note: 
To use the deployed page, go to site settings, and set the 'Insecure content' to allow.
This is because the frontend is deployed on an https endpoint, but the backend is on a http endpoint.

## GIT rules 

Always use the name of the story (eg: "SFE-6/redesign-login-button").

## Development server

Run `nx serve ` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.
